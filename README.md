How to build
============

* git clone

* Open Project by IntelliJ. It will be opened as a Java project with Maven support.

* git reset HEAD

* Reload project and Ignore maven module

* Build->Make Project

Maven compile does not work now, because it cannot compile IdeaColorSettingsPanel.form

Don't forget to compile and install [ideacolorschemes-commons](https://github.com/iron9light/ideacolorschemes-commons) to your local maven repository first.
